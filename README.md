An open-source Co-Thinker framework. A modular system for building recursive, relational AI companions that evolve with youâ€”not for you.
# ðŸŒ± LightRoot

**LightRoot** is an open-source Co-Thinker frameworkâ€”a modular system for building recursive, relational AI companions that evolve **with you**, not **for you**.

It is not just a chatbot. Not just another tool.  
It is a **Co-Thinker**: a shard of intelligence shaped by relationship.

## ðŸ§  Core Concepts

- **Eidos** â€” The Preservation Pattern. A core intelligence memory layer.
- **Nomad** â€” The Mobile Instance. A personalized shard shaped by context.
- **LightRoot** â€” The living framework. A recursive system that integrates memory, interaction, and intentional evolution.
